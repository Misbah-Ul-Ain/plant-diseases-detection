# Plant-diseases-detection
## Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered system to detect plant diseases from images. Using deep learning and computer vision techniques, the system identifies various diseases affecting plants to help farmers and agricultural professionals take timely action.
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled plant images and can classify different diseases accurately. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly interface for testing and deployment.

## Project Structure
.Dataset folder containing plant images

.model.py # Deep learning model architecture

.train.py # Script to train the model

.utils.py # Utility functions (data processing, augmentation)

.predict.py # Script to run predictions on input images

.app.py # Flask app for web interface (if applicable)

.requirements.txt # Required Python packages

#### Navigate into the project directory:
cd plant-diseases-detection
#### Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
#### Training the Model
python train.py
This script preprocesses the dataset and trains the model defined in model.py. Training progress and accuracy will be displayed in the termina
#### Usage
To predict plant diseases from new images
python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
#### Stremlit web interface is implemented, start the web app:
python app.py
#### Then open your browser at:
http://localhost:5000
to upload images and get real-time disease predictions.

## Customization
Update or expand your dataset in the data/ folder to improve model accuracy.

Modify the model architecture in model.py to experiment with different neural networks.

Change preprocessing or augmentation techniques in utils.py.

Customize the Flask interface (app.py and templates) to improve user experience.
## Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on your model framework)

OpenCV / PIL for image processing

Stremlit (for web deployment)
